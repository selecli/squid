.IX Title "Net::SNMP 3"
.TH Net::SNMP 3 "2009-02-24" "perl v5.8.5" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
Net::SNMP \- Object oriented interface to SNMP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
The Net::SNMP module implements an object oriented interface to the Simple 
Network Management Protocol.  Perl applications can use the module to retrieve 
or update information on a remote host using the \s-1SNMP\s0 protocol.  The module 
supports \s-1SNMP\s0 version\-1, \s-1SNMP\s0 version\-2c (Community\-Based SNMPv2), and \s-1SNMP\s0 
version\-3. The Net::SNMP module assumes that the user has a basic understanding
of the Simple Network Management Protocol and related network management 
concepts.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Net::SNMP module abstracts the intricate details of the Simple Network
Management Protocol by providing a high level programming interface to the
protocol.  Each Net::SNMP object provides a one-to-one mapping between a Perl
object and a remote \s-1SNMP\s0 agent or manager.  Once an object is created, it can
be used to perform the basic protocol exchange actions defined by \s-1SNMP\s0.
.PP
A Net::SNMP object can be created such that it has either \*(L"blocking\*(R" or
\&\*(L"non\-blocking\*(R" properties.  By default, the methods used to send \s-1SNMP\s0 messages
do not return until the protocol exchange has completed successfully or a
timeout period has expired. This behavior gives the object a \*(L"blocking\*(R"
property because the flow of the code is stopped until the method returns.
.PP
The optional named argument \fB\-nonblocking\fR can be passed to the object
constructor with a true value to give the object \*(L"non\-blocking\*(R" behavior.
A method invoked by a non-blocking object queues the \s-1SNMP\s0 message and returns
immediately, allowing the flow of the code to continue. The queued \s-1SNMP\s0 
messages are not sent until an event loop is entered by calling the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`snmp_dispatcher()\*(C'\fR method.  When the \s-1SNMP\s0 messages are sent, any response to 
the messages invokes the subroutine defined by the user when the message was 
originally queued. The event loop exits when all messages have been removed 
from the queue by either receiving a response, or by exceeding the number of 
retries at the Transport Layer.
.Sh "Blocking Objects"
.IX Subsection "Blocking Objects"
The default behavior of the methods associated with a Net::SNMP object is to
block the code flow until the method completes.  For methods that initiate a
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 protocol exchange requiring a response, a hash reference containing the
results of the query is returned. The undefined value is returned by all
methods when a failure has occurred. The \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method can be used to
determine the cause of the failure.
.PP
The hash reference returned by a \s-1SNMP\s0 protocol exchange points to a hash
constructed from the VarBindList contained in the \s-1SNMP\s0 response message.  The
hash is created using the ObjectName and the ObjectSyntax pairs in the
VarBindList.  The keys of the hash consist of the \s-1OBJECT\s0 IDENTIFIERs in dotted
notation corresponding to each ObjectName in the VarBindList.  The value of
each hash entry is set equal to the value of the corresponding ObjectSyntax.
This hash reference can also be retrieved using the \f(CW\*(C`var_bind_list()\*(C'\fR method.
.Sh "Non-blocking Objects"
.IX Subsection "Non-blocking Objects"
When a Net::SNMP object is created having non-blocking behavior, the invocation
of a method associated with the object returns immediately, allowing the flow 
of the code to continue.  When a method is invoked that would initiate a \s-1SNMP\s0
protocol exchange requiring a response, either a true value (i.e. 0x1) is
returned immediately or the undefined value is returned if there was a failure.
The \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method can be used to determine the cause of the failure.
.PP
The contents of the VarBindList contained in the \s-1SNMP\s0 response message can be
retrieved by calling the \f(CW\*(C`var_bind_list()\*(C'\fR method using the object reference
passed as the first argument to the callback.  The value returned by the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`var_bind_list()\*(C'\fR method is a hash reference created using the ObjectName and
the ObjectSyntax pairs in the VarBindList.  The keys of the hash consist of 
the \s-1OBJECT\s0 IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation corresponding to each ObjectName 
in the VarBindList.  The value of each hash entry is set equal to the value of
the corresponding ObjectSyntax. The undefined value is returned if there has 
been a failure and the \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method may be used to determine the reason.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
When named arguments are expected by the methods, two different styles are 
supported.  All examples in this documentation use the dashed-option style:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&       $object->method(-argument => $value);
.Ve
.PP
However, the \s-1IO::\s0 style is also allowed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&       $object->method(Argument => $value);
.Ve
.IP "Non-blocking Objects Arguments" 4
.IX Item "Non-blocking Objects Arguments"
When a Net::SNMP object has been created with a \*(L"non\-blocking\*(R" property, most
methods that generate a \s-1SNMP\s0 message take additional arguments to support this
property.
.RS 4
.IP "Callback" 4
.IX Item "Callback"
Most methods associated with a non-blocking object have an optional named
argument called \fB\-callback\fR.  The \fB\-callback\fR argument expects a reference
to a subroutine or to an array whose first element must be a reference to a
subroutine.  The subroutine defined by the \fB\-callback\fR option is executed when
a response to a \s-1SNMP\s0 message is received, an error condition has occurred, or
the number of retries for the message has been exceeded.
.Sp
When the \fB\-callback\fR argument only contains a subroutine reference, the
subroutine is evaluated passing a reference to the original Net::SNMP object 
as the only parameter.  If the \fB\-callback\fR argument was defined as an array
reference, all elements in the array are passed to subroutine after the
reference to the Net::SNMP object.  The first element, which is required to be
a reference to a subroutine, is removed before the remaining arguments are 
passed to that subroutine.
.Sp
Once one method is invoked with the \fB\-callback\fR argument, this argument stays
with the object and is used by any further calls to methods using the
\&\fB\-callback\fR option if the argument is absent.  The undefined value may be
passed to the \fB\-callback\fR argument to delete the callback.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR The subroutine being passed with the \fB\-callback\fR named argument
should not cause blocking itself.  This will cause all the actions in the event
loop to be stopped, defeating the non-blocking property of the Net::SNMP
module.
.IP "Delay" 4
.IX Item "Delay"
An optional argument \fB\-delay\fR can also be passed to non-blocking objects.  The
\&\fB\-delay\fR argument instructs the object to wait the number of seconds passed
to the argument before executing the \s-1SNMP\s0 protocol exchange.  The delay period 
starts when the event loop is entered.  The \fB\-delay\fR parameter is applied to 
all methods associated with the object once it is specified.  The delay value 
must be set back to 0 seconds to disable the delay parameter. 
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "SNMPv3 Arguments" 4
.IX Item "SNMPv3 Arguments"
A \s-1SNMP\s0 context is a collection of management information accessible by a \s-1SNMP\s0 
entity.  An item of management information may exist in more than one context 
and a \s-1SNMP\s0 entity potentially has access to many contexts.  The combination of 
a contextEngineID and a contextName unambiguously identifies a context within 
an administrative domain.  In a SNMPv3 message, the contextEngineID and 
contextName are included as part of the scopedPDU.  All methods that generate 
a \s-1SNMP\s0 message optionally take a \fB\-contextengineid\fR and \fB\-contextname\fR 
argument to configure these fields.
.RS 4
.IP "Context Engine \s-1ID\s0" 4
.IX Item "Context Engine ID"
The \fB\-contextengineid\fR argument expects a hexadecimal string representing
the desired contextEngineID.  The string must be 10 to 64 characters (5 to 
32 octets) long and can be prefixed with an optional \*(L"0x\*(R".  Once the 
\&\fB\-contextengineid\fR is specified it stays with the object until it is changed 
again or reset to default by passing in the undefined value.  By default, the 
contextEngineID is set to match the authoritativeEngineID of the authoritative
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 engine.
.IP "Context Name" 4
.IX Item "Context Name"
The contextName is passed as a string which must be 0 to 32 octets in length 
using the \fB\-contextname\fR argument.  The contextName stays with the object 
until it is changed.  The contextName defaults to an empty string which 
represents the \*(L"default\*(R" context.

.PP
This is the constructor for Net::SNMP objects.  In scalar context, a
reference to a new Net::SNMP object is returned if the creation of the object
is successful.  In list context, a reference to a new Net::SNMP object and an 
empty error message string is returned.  If a failure occurs, the object 
reference is returned as the undefined value.  The error string may be used 
to determine the cause of the error.
.PP
Most of the named arguments passed to the constructor define basic attributes
for the object and are not modifiable after the object has been created.  The
\&\fB\-timeout\fR, \fB\-retries\fR, \fB\-maxmsgsize\fR, \fB\-translate\fR, and \fB\-debug\fR
arguments are modifiable using an accessor method.  See their corresponding 
method definitions for a complete description of their usage, default values, 
and valid ranges.
.IP "Transport Domain Arguments" 4
.IX Item "Transport Domain Arguments"
The Net::SNMP module uses UDP/IPv4 as the default Transport Domain to exchange
\&\s-1SNMP\s0 messages between the local and remote devices.  The module also supports
UDP/IPv6, TCP/IPv4, and TCP/IPv6 as alternative Transport Domains.  The 
\&\fB\-domain\fR argument can be used to change the Transport Domain by setting the 
value to one of the following strings: 'udp6', 'udp/ipv6'; 'tcp', 'tcp4', 
\&'tcp/ipv4'; 'tcp6', or 'tcp/ipv6'.  The \fB\-domain\fR argument also accepts
the strings 'udp', 'udp4', or 'udp/ipv4' which correspond to the default
Transport Domain of UDP/IPv4.
.Sp
The transport address of the destination \s-1SNMP\s0 device can be specified using
the \fB\-hostname\fR argument.  This argument is optional and defaults to
\&\*(L"localhost\*(R".  The destination port number can be specified as part of the
transport address or by using the \fB\-port\fR argument.  Either a numeric port
number or a textual service name can be specified.  A numeric port number in
parentheses can optionally follow the service name.  This port number will
be used if the service name cannot be resolved.  If the destination port number
is not specified, the well-known \s-1SNMP\s0 port number 161 is used.
.Sp
By default the source transport address and port number are assigned 
dynamically by the local device on which the Net::SNMP module is being used.
This dynamic assignment can be overridden by using the \fB\-localaddr\fR and
\&\fB\-localport\fR arguments.  These arguments accept the same values as the
\&\fB\-hostname\fR and \fB\-port\fR arguments respectively.  The resolved address must
correspond to a valid address of an interface on the local device.
.Sp
When using an IPv4 Transport Domain, the transport address can be specified
as either an \s-1IP\s0 network hostname or an IPv4 address in standard dotted notation.
The port information can be optionally appended to the hostname or address
delimited by a colon.  The accepted IPv4 transport address formats are 
\&\f(CW\*(C`address\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`address:port\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`hostname\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`hostname:port\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
When using an IPv6 Transport Domain, the transport address can be specified
as an \s-1IP\s0 hostname (which will be looked up as a \s-1DNS\s0 quad-A record) or an IPv6
address in presentation format.  The port information can optionally be 
included following a colon after the hostname or address.  When including this
information after an IPv6 address, the address must be enclosed in square 
brackets.  The scope zone index (described in \s-1RFC\s0 4007) can be specified after
the address as a decimal value delimited by a percent sign.  The accepted
transport address formats for IPv6 are \f(CW\*(C`address\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`address%zone\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[address]:port\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[address%zone]:port\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`hostname\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`hostname:port\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Security Model Arguments" 4
.IX Item "Security Model Arguments"
The \fB\-version\fR argument controls which other arguments are expected or 
required by the \f(CW\*(C`session()\*(C'\fR constructor.  The Net::SNMP module supports 
SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3.  The module defaults to SNMPv1 if no \fB\-version\fR
argument is specified.  The \fB\-version\fR argument expects either a digit (i.e. 
\&'1', '2', or '3') or a string specifying the version (i.e. 'snmpv1', 
\&'snmpv2c', or 'snmpv3') to define the \s-1SNMP\s0 version. 
.Sp
The Security Model used by the Net::SNMP object is based on the \s-1SNMP\s0 version
associated with the object.  If the \s-1SNMP\s0 version is SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c a
Community-based Security Model will be used, while the User-based Security
Model (\s-1USM\s0) will be used if the version is SNMPv3.  
.RS 4
.IP "Community-based Security Model Argument" 4
.IX Item "Community-based Security Model Argument"
If the Security Model is Community\-based, the only argument available is the
\&\fB\-community\fR argument.  This argument expects a string that is to be used as
the \s-1SNMP\s0 community name.  By default the community name is set to 'public' 
if the argument is not present.
.IP "User-based Security Model Arguments" 4
.IX Item "User-based Security Model Arguments"
The User-based Security Model (\s-1USM\s0) used by SNMPv3 requires that a securityName
be specified using the \fB\-username\fR argument.  The creation of a Net::SNMP
object with the version set to SNMPv3 will fail if the \fB\-username\fR argument
is not present.  The \fB\-username\fR argument expects a string 1 to 32 octets
in length.
.Sp
Different levels of security are allowed by the User-based Security Model which
address authentication and privacy concerns.  A SNMPv3 Net::SNMP object will 
derive the security level (securityLevel) based on which of the following 
arguments are specified.
.Sp
By default a securityLevel of 'noAuthNoPriv' is assumed.  If the \fB\-authkey\fR 
or \fB\-authpassword\fR arguments are specified, the securityLevel becomes 
\&'authNoPriv'.  The \fB\-authpassword\fR argument expects a string which is at 
least 1 octet in length.  Optionally, the \fB\-authkey\fR argument can be used so 
that a plain text password does not have to be specified in a script.  The 
\&\fB\-authkey\fR argument expects a hexadecimal string produced by localizing the 
password with the authoritativeEngineID for the specific destination device.  
The \f(CW\*(C`snmpkey\*(C'\fR utility included with the distribution can be used to create 
the hexadecimal string (see snmpkey). 
.Sp
Two different hash algorithms are defined by SNMPv3 which can be used by the 
Security Model for authentication.  These algorithms are \s-1HMAC\-MD5\-96\s0 \*(L"\s-1MD5\s0\*(R" 
(\s-1RFC\s0 1321) and \s-1HMAC\-SHA\-96\s0 \*(L"\s-1SHA\-1\s0\*(R" (\s-1NIST\s0 \s-1FIPS\s0 \s-1PUB\s0 180\-1).   The default 
algorithm used by the module is \s-1HMAC\-MD5\-96\s0.  This behavior can be changed by 
using the \fB\-authprotocol\fR argument.  This argument expects either the string 
\&'md5' or 'sha' to be passed to modify the hash algorithm.
.Sp
By specifying the arguments \fB\-privkey\fR or \fB\-privpassword\fR the securityLevel
associated with the object becomes 'authPriv'.  According to SNMPv3, privacy 
requires the use of authentication.  Therefore, if either of these two 
arguments are present and the \fB\-authkey\fR or \fB\-authpassword\fR arguments are 
missing, the creation of the object fails.  The \fB\-privkey\fR and 
\&\fB\-privpassword\fR arguments expect the same input as the \fB\-authkey\fR and 
\&\fB\-authpassword\fR arguments respectively.
.Sp
The User-based Security Model described in \s-1RFC\s0 3414 defines a single encryption
protocol to be used for privacy.  This protocol, CBC-DES \*(L"\s-1DES\s0\*(R" (\s-1NIST\s0 \s-1FIPS\s0 \s-1PUB\s0 
46\-1), is used by default or if the string 'des' is passed to the 
\&\fB\-privprotocol\fR argument.  The module also supports \s-1RFC\s0 3826 which describes
the use of \s-1CFB128\-AES\-128\s0 \*(L"\s-1AES\s0\*(R" (\s-1NIST\s0 \s-1FIPS\s0 \s-1PUB\s0 197) in the \s-1USM\s0.  The \s-1AES\s0 
encryption protocol can be selected by passing 'aes' or 'aes128' to the 
\&\fB\-privprotocol\fR argument.  By working with the Extended Security Options
Consortium <http://www.snmp.com/eso/>, the module also supports \s-1CBC\-3DES\-EDE\s0

The default value for the trap \fB\-enterprise\fR is \*(L"1.3.6.1.4.1\*(R", which 
corresponds to \*(L"iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises\*(R".  The enterprise

.IP "\(bu" 4
When the Transport Domain is UDP/IPv4 or TCP/IPv4, the default value for the
trap \fB\-agentaddr\fR is the \s-1IP\s0 address associated with the interface on which 
the trap will be transmitted.  For other Transport Domains the \fB\-agentaddr\fR
is defaulted to \*(L"0.0.0.0\*(R".  When specified, the agent-addr is expected to be
an IpAddress in dotted notation.

The default value for the \fB\-specifictrap\fR type is 0.  No pre-defined values
are available for specific-trap types.

The default value for the trap \fB\-timestamp\fR is the \*(L"uptime\*(R" of the script.  
The \*(L"uptime\*(R" of the script is the number of hundredths of seconds that have 
elapsed since the script began running.  The time-stamp is expected to be a 
TimeTicks number in hundredths of seconds.

The variable-bindings are expected to be in an array format consisting of 
groups of an \s-1OBJECT\s0 \s-1IDENTIFIER\s0, an object type, and the actual value of the 
object.  This is identical to the list expected by the \f(CW\*(C`set_request()\*(C'\fR method.

on the host associated with the Net::SNMP object.  Each message specifically
requests data for each \s-1OBJECT\s0 \s-1IDENTIFIER\s0 specified in the \fB\-columns\fR array.
The \s-1OBJECT\s0 IDENTIFIERs must correspond to column entries for a conceptual row 
in a table.  They may however be columns in different tables as long as each
table is indexed the same way.  The optional \fB\-startindex\fR and \fB\-endindex\fR

If no \fB\-startindex\fR is specified, the first request message will be sent
without an index.  To insure that the \fB\-startindex\fR is included, the last
subidentifier in the index is decremented by one.  If the last subidentifier
has a value of zero, the subidentifier is removed from the index.

The optional \fB\-endindex\fR argument can be specified as a single decimal value
or in dotted notation.  If the \fB\-endindex\fR is specified, it will be included

When the object decodes the GetResponse-PDU that is returned in response to 
a \s-1SNMP\s0 message, certain values are translated into a more \*(L"human readable\*(R" 
form.  By default the following translations occur: 
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1OCTET\s0 STRINGs and Opaques containing non-printable \s-1ASCII\s0 characters are 
converted into a hexadecimal representation prefixed with \*(L"0x\*(R".  \fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR  
The following \s-1ASCII\s0 control characters are considered to be printable by
the module:  \s-1NUL\s0(0x00), \s-1HT\s0(0x09), \s-1LF\s0(0x0A), \s-1FF\s0(0x0C), and \s-1CR\s0(0x0D). 
.IP "\(bu" 4
TimeTicks integer values are converted to a time format.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1NULL\s0 values return the string \*(L"\s-1NULL\s0\*(R" instead of an empty string.
.IP "\(bu" 4
noSuchObject exception values return the string \*(L"noSuchObject\*(R" instead of an
empty string.  If translation is not enabled, the \s-1SNMP\s0 error-status field
is set to 128 which is equal to the exported definition \s-1NOSUCHOBJECT\s0 (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").
.IP "\(bu" 4
noSuchInstance exception values return the string \*(L"noSuchInstance\*(R" instead of 
an empty string.  If translation is not enabled, the \s-1SNMP\s0 error-status field
is set to 129 which is equal to the exported definition \s-1NOSUCHINSTANCE\s0 (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").
.IP "\(bu" 4
endOfMibView exception values return the string \*(L"endOfMibView\*(R" instead of an
empty string.  If translation is not enabled, the \s-1SNMP\s0 error-status field
is set to 130 which is equal to the exported definition \s-1ENDOFMIBVIEW\s0 (see 
\&\*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").
.IP "\(bu" 4
Counter64, Counter, Gauge, and TimeTick values that have been incorrectly 
encoded as signed negative values are returned as unsigned values.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`translate()\*(C'\fR method can be invoked with two different types of arguments.
.PP
If the argument passed is any Perl variable type except an array reference,
the translation mode for all \s-1ASN\s0.1 types is set to either enabled or disabled, 
depending on the value of the passed parameter.  Any value that Perl would 
treat as a true value will set the mode to be enabled for all types, while a 
false value will disable translation for all types.
.PP
A reference to an array can be passed to the \f(CW\*(C`translate()\*(C'\fR method in order to
define the translation mode on a per \s-1ASN\s0.1 type basis.  The array is expected
to contain a list of named argument pairs for each \s-1ASN\s0.1 type that is to
be modified.  The arguments in the list are applied in the order that they
are passed in via the array.  Arguments at the end of the list supercede 
those passed earlier in the list.  The argument \*(L"\-all\*(R" can be used to specify
that the mode is to apply to all \s-1ASN\s0.1 types.  Only the arguments for the 
\&\s-1ASN\s0.1 types that are to be modified need to be included in the list.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`translate()\*(C'\fR method returns a bit mask indicating which \s-1ASN\s0.1 types
are to be translated.  Definitions of the bit to \s-1ASN\s0.1 type mappings can be
exported using the \fI:translate\fR tag (see \*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").  The undefined value 
is returned upon an error and the \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method may be used to determine 
the cause.

.IX Subsection "debug() - set or get the debug mode for the module"
.Vb 1
\&   $mask = $session->debug([$mask]);
.Ve
.PP
This method is used to enable or disable debugging for the Net::SNMP module. 
Debugging can be enabled on a per component level as defined by a bit mask
passed to the \f(CW\*(C`debug()\*(C'\fR method.  The bit mask is broken up as follows:
.IP "\(bu" 4
0x02 \- Message or \s-1PDU\s0 encoding and decoding 
.IP "\(bu" 4
0x04 \- Transport Layer 
.IP "\(bu" 4
0x08 \- Dispatcher 
.IP "\(bu" 4
0x10 \- Message Processing  
.IP "\(bu" 4
0x20 \- Security
.PP
Symbols representing these bit mask values are defined by the module and can
be exported using the \fI:debug\fR tag (see \*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").  If a non-numeric
value is passed to the \f(CW\*(C`debug()\*(C'\fR method, it is evaluated in boolean context.
Debugging for all of the components is then enabled or disabled based on the
resulting truth value.
.PP
The current debugging mask is returned by the method.  Debugging can also be
enabled using the stand alone function \f(CW\*(C`snmp_debug()\*(C'\fR. This function can be
exported by request (see \*(L"\s-1EXPORTS\s0\*(R").
